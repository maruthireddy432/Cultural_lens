## 🧭 Cultural Lens: A Data-Driven Platform for Promoting Indian Art & Responsible Tourism
# 🖼️ Overview
Cultural Lens is a Streamlit-based interactive web application designed to showcase India's diverse art forms, forecast cultural tourism trends, and recommend responsible travel spots. Leveraging open data and machine learning, it enables users to:

- Discover endangered traditional art forms
- Generate personalized, low-impact cultural travel routes
- Developed as part of the YourStory | Snowflake - Hero Challenge by Hacker earth, this project aims to bridge the gap between tourism, culture, and data-driven policy insights.

# 🔍 Problem Statement
Design a solution to promote India's cultural diversity and responsible tourism using data and Streamlit.
India’s rich cultural heritage is often underrepresented in mainstream tourism. Many traditional art forms are fading due to low awareness and uneven visitor distribution. This solution uses a data-first approach to:
- Highlight underexplored cultural sites
- Forecast seasonal tourism to optimize travel and resource planning
- Suggest alternate routes that preserve fragile destinations

# 🧠 Tech Stack

- Web Interface:	Streamlit
- Data Analysis:	Pandas, NumPy
- Mapping:	Folium, geopy, haversine
- Visualization:	Plotly, Streamlit-Folium
- Deployment:	Streamlit Cloud
